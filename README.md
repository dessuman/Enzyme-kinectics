# Enzyme kinetics is the study of how biological catalysts facilitates and regulates reaction rates in biochemical reactions. Without such catalysts, the biological processesnecessary for organisms would not proceed at a rate that would sustain life. This document investigates how the enzymes can be modelled quantitatively. We will explore the kinetic behavior of the scheme for both the reversible and irreversible reaction by deriving a system of differential equations and using both an equilibrium approximation and quasi-steady-state approximation to determine the rate of product formation for these reactions. The resulting system of differential equation is studied for steady state and interesting dependencies on parameters are explored.
